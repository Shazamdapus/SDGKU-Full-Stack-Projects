<h2>Who is Writing This Nonsense?!</h2>
<p>Hello, my name is Quincy Stieber and welcome to my webpage.  I am an avid gamer and this is my first real step into the realm<br>
of games journalism and reviews, and I thought what better way to kick off my career than to review one of the most<br>
anticipated games of the last decade, <strong>Read Dead Redemption 2</strong>.  This is my way of showing my appreciation for the game<br>
and the series as a whole, not to mention a big fan of Rockstar<sup>tm</sup> games.  So grab a bottle of shine and put in<br>
a big ol' chaw, because this is gonna be one hell of a ride!!</p>

<h3>Cowboy or Cowpoke?</h3>
<p>The original,<strong>Red Dead Revolover</strong>, showcased a protagonist straight out of any 1960's western.  A boy that lost everything<br>
at a young age, only to find revenge and a Colt<sup>tm</sup> single action as his best friends.  Simply named "RED", he showed<br>
everyone in his path exactly why he was the greatest gun slinger in the West.  Accompanied by a cast of characters just as<br>
misfit as him, the game culminated in a battle so good, it would make John Wayne proud.</p>
<br>
<p>Although the game was recieved well by critics, the fan base wasnt as big as <strong>Rockstar</strong><sup>tm</sup> had hoped.  I personally<br>
loved the game, and sank countless hours into the campaign as well as the great multiplayer modes.  Being a huge fan of Clint<br>
Eastwood and John Wayne, it satisfied an itch I always had to live out a western fantasy.  When the sequal was announced years<br>
later, I was beside myself with joy.  The thought of continuing the story of Red was very exciting.  Unfortunatley, it was not<br>
quite how I had imagined it in my dreams.</p>
<br>
<p>Enter <strong>John Marston</strong>.  He was everything a good protagonist should be, confident, conficted and most of all a gigantic mystery.<br>
From the opening sequence until the credits rolled, it was a non-stop action filled adventure that had me smiling every step of<br>
the way.  Players became fully invested in the man who is <strong>John Marston</strong>, former gang member turned government agent, tasked with<br>
hunting down his former gang memebers.  Once his task was complete, the evil government agent Edgar Ross, would release his wife<br>
and son back to him.  The plot was simple sure, but the execution was flawless.  The characters you meet along the way, and the<br>
interactions between them and John were priceless and more fulfilling and interesting than the original.  John Marston and his<br>
story become legend, especially after the epic conclusion that had everyone in shock.  We all hoped to continue the story, but<br>
as the years went by and the release of GTAV, it seemed like it was going to be a long time before we could.</p>
<br>
<p>8 years later, fans around the world rejoiced when the first teaser trailer of Red Dead Redemption 2 was released, but it was<br>
not John Marston who was center stage.  Instead it was the gravely voiced Arthur Morgan carrying the torch.  But who is this Arthur?<br>
And where is John?</p>
<br>
<p>I was definatly a little put off by the not being able to play as <strong>John Marston</strong>, and I was really not sure of how the narrative<br>
would work with Arthur.  Much to my surprise, I think he is much better than John.  It saddens me a little to say that, but it is<br>
most definatley the truth.  <strong>Arthur Morgan</strong>is everything I thought a gunslinger in the west should be.  He takes every great quality<br>
John had and expanded on it ten fold.  Although you already know the outcome of his story, the ride you go on from beginning to end<br>
is incredible, and should be experienced by everyone.  His interactions with the world and being able to see everything through his<br>
eyes really put the events of <strong>Red Dead Redemption</strong> into perspective, and even shined a new light on John.  The writers did an<br>
incredible job, worthy of any big budget TV show or movie.  You dont play as Arthur Morgan, you become him.  Every decision that you<br>
make, you do with him in mind.  Do you help an old girlfriend that although she loved Arthur dearly, turned her back on him beacuse<br>
she was ashamed to tell her family that she was in love with an outlaw?  Should Arthur help a woman in the group go on a suicide mission<br>
to get revenge on the group of bad guys that killed her husband and ruined her life?  Who Arthur is and who he becomes at the end of the<br>
game is entirely up to you.</p>
<br>
<p>This game does so many things amazingly well, that it becomes hard to see some of its faults and it does have some.  In this game you will<br>
spend and exceptional amount of time riding your horse, so you better find one that you like.  It becomes a chore sometimes to get some of<br>
the games locations, especially some of the best ones.  The game is beautiful, every section of the map offers some type of new secenery<br>
to gawk at while you ride, but as the end of the 60+ hour campaign draws to a close, it begins to wear down on you a little bit.  That brings<br>
me to my next point, this story is most definatly a slow burn.  We all know what happens to <strong>Dutch Van Der Linde</strong> because of his role in the<br>
original, but the mystery of this game is how exactly he gets there.  I would say that for 2/3's of this game you spend a good bit of time<br>
waiting for the moment that Dutch goes form the guy you meet at the beginning to this game, to the guy you have to chase through the mountains<br>
as John.  However, when it does happen, it is fantastic and leads to some of the most tense and well written segments of the game.  There is<br>
a ton of things to do in this game, and to complete it all becomes quite a daunting task, especially for casual players.  I used to have a<br>
lot of free time to devote to playing video games, but with a full time job, a young family and school, most of my time is spoken for already.<br>
This becomes a bit of a gripe I have more than a flaw in the game.  It takes a lot of time and dedication to unlock the game's most pretigous<br>
item, the Legends of the East outfit, however it requires you to have completed the main story to unlock the remaining areas previously blocked<br>
to you.  This is something I really do not like, I wnat to be able to complete the story with the rare outfit, so I can go into the last act<br>
looking like a boss.  I will say this though, there are so many great clothing items in the game especially from the trapper, that I did look<br>
like a boss when the final credits rolled.  It just takes a bunch of time and dedication to collect all the pelts to unlock some of the game's<br>
best items.  Most players will probably write this off as me being picky, but I am just giving my opinion.  In this title, the shooting<br>
mechanics also left me wanting more.  With so many great shooters produced by Rockstar, especially the Max Payne series, that the gunfights<br>
tend to feel a bit clunky at times instead of capturing some of the magic that made the western movies of the 50's and 60's so great.  Once<br>
I adjusted my controls and messed around with my button layout, I was able to remedy most of the issues I had.  I will say that the gunfights do<br>
feel engaging and they offer a lot of cool effects and moments, especially a lot of the marquee set pieces.  Although this maybe my biggest<br>
section of my review, nothing that I have stated here in any way makes me feel like the game lacked anything, or drove me away from it.<br>
Everything has flaws, and this game is no exception.</p>
<p><strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong> sets a standard for what a video game should be, and what this art form has to offer people.  The details that the<br>
developers put into this world is quite incredible.  Everything feels real, from the time it takes for Arthur to grow a beard, to the way<br>
your horse's muscles move when he trots versus galloping feels authentic.  Rockstar<sup>tm</sup> eight years to build this masterpiece, and<br>
it shows in every single aspect of the game.  This game will be remembered for a long time, and will be mentioned along with Goldeneye<sup>tm</sup><br>
Final Fantasy VII<sup>tm</sup>, Super Mario Bros 2<sup>tm</sup>, Halo 2<sup>tm</sup>, and Ocorina of Time<sup>tm</sup>.  I cannot state how<br>
highly I regard this game, and I consider it tied for the best game of the generation with The Witcher III.  These two games I honestly consider<br>
to be the two best games of the last ten years, and possibly the two best games I have ever played.  <strong>Red Dead Redemption 2</strong> is an absolute<br>
masterpiece and I will be handing a copy of this to my kids when they come of age.  Every game from here on out will somehow be influenced by<br>
what Rockstar with this title.  Take a bow Rockstar, you more than deserve it.</p>
