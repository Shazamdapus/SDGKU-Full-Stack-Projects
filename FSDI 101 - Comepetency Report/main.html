    <p div id = "pizzaintro">In order to decide what pizza place is the best in town,<br>
    I critiqued each place on four critetia, <i>crust</i>, <i>toppings</i>, <i>sauce</i>, and <i>value</i>.<br>
    Each area was graded on a scale from one to four.  Some of these places offer a quite<br>
    different dining experience, but the purpose of this site is to find the<br>
    best pizza, dining experience is not judged here.  Sure everyone wants to have<br>
    a good dining experience, but pizza is something that can be enjoyed in the store,<br>
    but just as easily at home too.  I am a west sider, but I did not use that bias to<br>
    judge these places either.  In Cleveland there is a definate rivalry between the east<br>
    and west sides, but I assure you that did not affect my decision.  Good pizza should<br>
    be enjoyed by everyone.  I had so much fun making this list, I really hope this helps<br>
    you and leads you to your next favorite pizza place.</p>

    <h2 div id = "angeloshead">&nbsp;Angelo's Pizza &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lakewood, OH</h2>
    <p div id = "angelospizza">When Cleveland was still a young city, it was divided into several smaller neighborhoods.<br>
    On the west side, on of those neighborhoods became its own city pretty quickly.  Enter Lakewood, OH.<br>
    Sitting right on the shores of Lake Erie, this town is home to so many great bars and restaurants, an entire<br>
    website could be devoted to just that.  But there is one place that is synonymous with Lakewood, Angelo's Pizza.<br>
    It is a small unassuming place just a couple of blocks from the park, and a couple more from all the action on<br>
    Detroit Rd.  However, any night of the week this section of Madison Ave is packed full of cars and people waiting<br>
    for their chance to get a table.  There are two things everyone knows about Angelo's, the wait is always long and the<br>
    pizza is the best in the city.  East siders and West siders alike come here whenever possible to get their pizza fix.</p>

    <ol type = "1" div id = "angeloslist">
        <li>Crust - 4.5/5</li>
        <li>Sauce - 4/5</li>
        <li>Toppings - 5/5</li>
        <li>Value - 4/5</li>
    </ol>

    <p div id = "prosandcons">
        Pros: The crust is the best around, its so light and fluffy and does an amazing job soaking up all th oils and<br>
        grease from the cooking process and is never hard or chewy.  The sauce works with their most famous pizzas, there<br>
        isnt another sauce that makes a deluxe pizza this good.  Every pizza they make has fantasic toppings, especially<br>
        the deluxe.  In Cleveland deluxe pizza is king, and Angelo's deluxe sets the standard.<br>
        <br>
        Cons: Pizza from Angelo's can get quite expensive sometimes, especially when ordering for a party.  Two large pizzas<br>
        will run you about $45.  Also, their sauce doesnt work with every pizza they have, for example, their hawian pizza<br>
        isnt that great because their sauce has a lot of garlic and is pretty acidic, throwing off the balance of that particualr<br>
        pizza.<br>
        <br>
        Final Verdict: If you want amazing pizza, there is no better place in Cleveland than Angelo's Pizza of Lakewood.  They<br>
        do everything right when it comes to making a pizza.  Its a bit expensive, and if you live on the east side, it can be a<br>
        journey.  It is well worth the price and the wait, Angelo's is just that good.
