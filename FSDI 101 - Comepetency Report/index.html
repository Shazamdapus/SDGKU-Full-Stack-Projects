    <p div id = "openpara">Hello and welcome to my site.  My name is Quincy Stieber, and I am a resident of Cleveland, OH.<br>
    This is really a great city, with plenty of great places to eat.  That is what really seperates us<br>
    from many other cities in the Midwest.  Cleveland is known for curating amazing chefs and amazing<br>
    restaurants that will satisfy anyone's tastes.  If you take a trip to the south side of the city and<br>
    end up in Parma, you can feast on any one of a number of fantasic Polish restaurants.  The east side<br>
    of the city is full of great family owned deli's and diners, like <strong>Slyman's Deli</strong> and<br>
    <strong>Sokolowski's University Inn</strong>.  The west side, is full of alternative dining options,<br>
    like all different types of Pho and Indian restaurants, as well as places that give you endless vegan<br>
    and vegetarian options.  Cleveland is well known for being a <i>"foodie"</i> town, and it definatly<br>
    lives up to its reputation.  However, at this site, I will be covering what I consider to be one of the<br>
    most important barometers for judging great food cities, <strong>pizza</strong>.  Chicago has deep dish<br>
    and New York has the "New York Style" pizza, but Cleveland has both which already puts it ahead in my book.<br>
    This site is designed to give you a brief overview of some of the city's best places so you know what to<br>
    expect and help you make a good decision if you are trying to figure out where to go.  I hope you enjoy<br>
    all of what this site has to offer, and welcome to the best pizza scene around!</p>
