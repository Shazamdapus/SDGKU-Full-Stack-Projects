    <h1>This Is A Sample Page Showing Off CSS!!</h1>
    <p div id= "internalp";>This is an example of how you use internal CSS.  Although it is effective,<br>
    it makes changing style in a web page cumbersome and muddies up the html code.<br>
    Best practice is to use and external style sheet.</p>
    <hr>

    <h3 div id = "exthead";>External Style Sheets Are Way Better!!</h3>
        <p div id = "extparaone";>When it comes to setting style for your web page, external style<br>
        sheets are the best option.  It helps keep the functional html code clear<br>
        but also allows the programmer easy access to change the style of the page.<br>
        Using an external stylesheet also allows you to apply the same style<br>
        to multiple pages by simply just linking the sheet to the other pages.</p>

        <p div id = "extparatwo";>It also allows you to change the style of individual elements in the page<br>
            just as long as you set up the id's correctly.  See how much different<br>
            this paragraph is to the one above it?  Thats because I used a different<br>
            id and linked that to a different style on my CSS.  The power of the CSS<br>
            is strong with this one!!</p>
